Genspace is the world’s first community biology lab — a place where people of all backgrounds can learn, create, and grow with the life sciences. 

# About
Since 2009, we have served the greater New York area by providing hands-on STEAM education programs for youth and adults, cultural and outreach events for the public, and a membership program to support New York’s community of creatives, researchers, and entrepreneurs. Our programs demystify scientific processes, provide a platform for innovation, and cultivate the next generation of life sciences leaders in emerging global technologies, such as biotechnology, neuroscience, epidemiology, genomics, and many more. 

# History
The Biosafety Level 1 laboratory opened in December 2010. Co-founded by  Ellen Jorgensen, Nurit Bar-Shai, Oliver Medvedik, and Daniel Grushkin.
